        <h1>Things <br>to Do <br>in Cleveland</h1>
        <p>Some people say, “Cleveland is in <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/FXLAJrNwdArmdZSd8">the middle of nowhere</a>,”; others say, “It’s hidden gam.”&nbsp;
        <br>Let’s see what we can do in the Land in art, music, nature, sports & beer.</p>

          <h2 id="art">Art</h2>
          <p>First, we have art culture in Cleveland. We can go to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clevelandart.org/"> Cleveland Museum of Art</a> & <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mocacleveland.org/"> Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland</a> for free. Surprisingly we can see Monet, Picasso, Rodin and other famous artists for free. My favorite is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1991.134.2"> this guy</a>.</p>
          <p>Besides the museums, we can see art work outside, too. For example, this <a target="_blank" href="https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/571"> Free Stamp</a> is famous for against big corporations. Originally the art was located in front of a building used to be British Petroleum headquarters. BP actually planned some object in front of the building, and the Free Stamp came out. Of course they didn’t like it, so they sold the object to the city, and not the stamp faces to the building…</p>

        <h2 id="nature">Nature</h2>
        <p>Cleveland is facing one of Great Lakes, Lake Erie, & we have a couple of parks on the edge. Well, those parks are a part of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/">Cleveland Metro Park</a>, and it’s called Emerald Neckless since a space of Metro Park is a hard circle, like a neckless. One of interesting facts is about migrating birds. They move to Canada over Lake Erie in Summer. Sometimes they stop by the US side, and stay for a while or before Winter. That means Cleavena has more variety of birds.</p>
        <p>If you like to learn more about Lake Erie, you should go to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.greaterclevelandaquarium.com/">Greater Cleveland Aquarium</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://greatscience.com/">Great Lake Science Center</a>.</p>

        <p>Recently, Cleveland Indians announced that they are going to change their name to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mlb.com/indians/fans/cleteamname">Guardians</a> in 2022. You can listen where the name Guardians came from, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ideastream.org/news/exploring-the-history-and-popularity-of-cleveland-s-guardians-of-traffic">here</a>.</p>

      <p>If you love beer, Ohio, well Cleveland is where you will enjoy. There are so many great micro breweries in Cleveland. Like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.greatlakesbrewing.com/">Great Lakes Brewing</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://fatheads.com/brewery.html">Fat Head’s</a>, those breweries have tap rooms/restaunrants, so you can enjoy beer with good food. I will recommend to try a <a target="_blank" href="    https://learn.kegerator.com/beer-flights/">beer flight</a>, first, then you can order one you most like.</p>
      <p>Somehow, we have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clevelandoktoberfest.com">Oktoberfest here in Cleveland</a>, but it’s usually in September. Is it right? Anyway, North East Ohio had German migrants, that is why we have some German influenced events, like this.</p>
